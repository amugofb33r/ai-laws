# Colorado Insurance Regulation 10-1-1 
## **1. What It Is — Regulation Overview**

**Colorado Insurance Regulation 10-1-1** is a **governance and risk management framework regulation** issued by the Colorado Division of Insurance (CDOI) that governs how insurers use **external consumer data and information sources (ECDIS)** and **algorithms or predictive models** that rely on that data. ([Deloitte][1])

* Originally adopted in **2023** for **life insurers** and effective **November 14, 2023**. ([Colorado Department of Insurance][2])
* **Amended August 20, 2025**, and effective **October 15, 2025**, to expand scope to additional insurance lines. ([Debevoise][3])
* The regulation is intended to ensure that the use of ECDIS and algorithmic models (including AI) is **governed, documented, tested, monitored, and controlled** to address potential unfair discrimination (especially with respect to race). ([Deloitte][1])

**ECDIS** broadly includes **external consumer data sources used to supplement or replace traditional underwriting factors or establish lifestyle indicators**—examples include credit data, social media, telematics, IoT data, and more. ([Deloitte][1])

---

## **2. Who It Applies To — Covered Entities**

The amended Regulation applies to insurers **authorized to do business in Colorado** that use ECDIS and related algorithms/predictive models in any insurance practice. ([Insure Reinsure][4])

**Covered insurer categories now include:**

* **Life Insurance Companies** (original scope). ([Deloitte][1])
* **Private Passenger Automobile Insurers** (added). ([Debevoise][3])
* **Health Benefit Plan Insurers** (added). ([Debevoise][3])

(All must comply if they use ECDIS, AI, or models based on these data.) ([Insure Reinsure][4])

---

## **3. Why It Matters — Purpose and Policy Goals**

The regulation reflects **Colorado’s effort to manage the risks of algorithmic decision-making and AI-like tools** in the insurance industry. ([PwC][5])

Key policy goals include:

* **Preventing unfair discrimination** in insurance practices based on external data and models. ([Deloitte][1])

# NYDFS Insurance Circular Letter No. 7 Section B

## **1) What It Is — Overview**

**NYDFS Insurance Circular Letter No. 7** is a supervisory guidance document issued by the New York State Department of Financial Services that sets out the Department’s expectations for how insurers should **develop, govern, manage, and monitor the use of Artificial Intelligence Systems (AIS) and External Consumer Data and Information Sources (ECDIS)** in the context of **insurance underwriting and pricing**. It establishes principles, governance expectations, testing and documentation requirements, and consumer transparency standards to ensure that the use of these technologies complies with applicable state and federal law and does not lead to unfair or unlawful discrimination. ([Department of Financial Services][1])

AIS is defined as machine-based systems performing functions typically associated with human intelligence (such as learning or reasoning) used to **supplement or proxy traditional underwriting or pricing**, including identifying lifestyle indicators. ECDIS is defined as external data or information used to supplement or proxy traditional underwriting or pricing. ([Department of Financial Services][1])

---

## **2) Who It Applies To — Covered Entities**

This Circular Letter **applies to all insurers authorized to write insurance in New York State**, including:

* Standard insurance companies licensed in New York,
* **Article 43 corporations**,
* **Health maintenance organizations (HMOs)**,
* **Licensed fraternal benefit societies**, and
* The **New York State Insurance Fund**. ([Department of Financial Services][1])

It is specifically aimed at those entities that use **AIS and ECDIS** in their underwriting and pricing processes. ([Department of Financial Services][1])

---

## **3) Why It Matters — Purpose and Policy Goals**

The Circular Letter is designed to advance **responsible innovation** while **protecting consumers** by ensuring that the integration of modern algorithmic and data-driven tools into insurance decision-making is safe, **fair**, and lawful. It seeks to:

* **Mitigate the risk of unfair or unlawful discrimination**, especially against protected classes, inherent in new data sources and AI systems. ([Department of Financial Services][2])
* Encourage **governance, oversight, and risk management** structures that hold insurers accountable for the outcomes of AIS and ECDIS use. ([Department of Financial Services][2])
* Ensure **transparency** with consumers about how their data is used in underwriting and pricing. ([Department of Financial Services][1])
* Promote **accuracy, reliability, and actuarial validity** of models and data sources used in insurance decisions. ([Department of Financial Services][2])

NYDFS underscores that while AIS and ECDIS can enhance efficiency and accuracy, they also raise concerns about bias, systemic inequities, and market integrity if not properly controlled. ([Department of Financial Services][1])

---

## **4) What Regulators Expect — Compliance Requirements**

NYDFS expects insurers to implement robust frameworks covering the **governance, testing, documentation, and oversight** of AIS and ECDIS. Key expectations include:

### **a. Governance and Oversight**

* Boards and senior management must **own responsibility for outcomes** of AIS and ECDIS use (not necessarily day-to-day execution). ([Department of Financial Services][1])
* A **risk-based approach** must be taken to guide the extent of oversight relative to the complexity and materiality of AIS and ECDIS use. ([Department of Financial Services][1])

### **b. Fairness and Anti-Discrimination**

* Insurers must ensure AIS and ECDIS **do not result in unfair or unlawful discrimination** against protected classes under state/federal law. ([Department of Financial Services][1])
* A **comprehensive assessment** process (quantitative and qualitative) is expected to identify discriminative effects and consider less discriminatory alternatives. ([Department of Financial Services][3])

### **c. Policies, Procedures, Documentation**

* Insurers must develop **written policies** governing AIS and ECDIS use, including roles, monitoring, reporting, and training. ([Department of Financial Services][1])
* Maintain **comprehensive documentation** of AIS models and ECDIS data sources, including testing records, model descriptions, risk assessments, and audit trails. ([Department of Financial Services][1])

### **d. Testing and Monitoring**

* Regular **testing for discrimination and model performance**, including before deployment and on an ongoing basis, is expected. ([Mayer Brown][4])

### **e. Third-Party Oversight**

* Insurers retain responsibility for AIS and ECDIS even if sourced from third-party vendors and must institute appropriate due diligence, contractual safeguards, and oversight. ([Department of Financial Services][1])

### **f. Consumer Transparency**

* Insurers must disclose to individuals that AIS/ECDIS are used, identify the data sources, and provide **reasons for adverse underwriting decisions**, including data and sources involved. ([Department of Financial Services][1])

---

## **5) Key Risks If Unmanaged**

Failing to properly manage AIS and ECDIS can expose insurers to a range of risks:

* **Regulatory and Legal Risk:** Violations of anti-discrimination laws or supervisory guidance can lead to enforcement actions or sanctions. ([Department of Financial Services][2])
* **Consumer Harm:** Unchecked biases in models or data could produce discriminatory outcomes, harming protected classes. ([Department of Financial Services][3])
* **Reputational Risk:** Poor transparency or unfair pricing decisions may erode consumer trust and brand reputation. ([Department of Financial Services][2])
* **Operational and Model Risk:** Inaccurate or poorly validated models may produce unreliable underwriting decisions, undermining risk management and pricing accuracy. ([Mayer Brown][4])

---

## **6) Practical Takeaway — What Insurers Should Do**

To align with NYDFS expectations and mitigate risk, insurers using AIS or ECDIS should take concrete steps:

### **a. Establish Solid Governance**

* Form or strengthen board and senior management oversight structures for AIS/ECDIS governance proportional to their use and risk. ([Department of Financial Services][1])

### **b. Implement Comprehensive Controls**

* Develop, document, and enforce policies and procedures covering model development, testing, validation, documentation, and lifecycle management. ([Department of Financial Services][1])

### **c. Conduct Discrimination Assessment**

* Perform rigorous quantitative and qualitative testing for unfair or unlawful discrimination and iterate to use less discriminatory alternatives when feasible. ([Department of Financial Services][3])

### **d. Maintain Transparent Consumer Communications**

* Inform applicants when AIS/ECDIS are used and provide accessible explanations for adverse underwriting decisions, including source data. ([Department of Financial Services][1])

### **e. Assess Third-Party Tools**

* Institute vendor oversight processes, including contractual rights to audits and cooperation in regulatory matters. ([Department of Financial Services][1])

By following these steps and documenting each component, insurers can better comply with NYDFS’s guidance, support fair consumer outcomes, and harness innovation responsibly. ([Department of Financial Services][2])
