Thanks — and you’re **absolutely right** about *Colorado Regulation 10‑1‑1*. The original regulation came into effect in **November 2023**, and a broadened amended version is **scheduled to take effect on October 15, 2025** for expanded applicability to additional lines of business. ([GovDelivery][1])

I’ve updated the executive summaries below with verified **“Issued”** and **“Effective”** dates where available, based on authoritative sources.

## **Colorado Regulation 10‑1‑1 (ECDIS)**

**Overview (How it Started, Issued & Effective Date)**
Colorado first adopted Regulation 10‑1‑1 to establish a governance and risk management framework for insurers’ use of external consumer data and related algorithms in insurance practices. It was **issued on September 21, 2023** and became effective on **November 14, 2023** for life insurers. An **amended version was adopted on August 20, 2025**, expanding the regulation to private passenger auto and health benefit plan insurers, with an **effective date of October 15, 2025**. ([GovDelivery][2])

**Who It Applies To**
Life insurers initially; amended version expands to private passenger auto and health benefit plan insurers using ECDIS, algorithms, or predictive models. ([Faegre Drinker][3])

**Regulatory Expectations**
Governance structures, documented model objectives, bias/accuracy testing, performance monitoring, and board-level oversight for AI/ECDIS use. ([insurereinsure.com][4])

**Risk if Unmanaged**
Noncompliance risks include regulatory enforcement actions, corrective orders, reporting requirements, and reputational harm. ([Faegre Drinker][3])

**Why the Leadership Should Care**
Broad scope and short compliance timelines for new lines mean enterprise AI governance must be prioritized now to avoid supervisory findings or corrective orders.

**Leadership Takeaway**
Inventory systems, align governance frameworks with the amended regulation’s requirements, and ensure interim reporting and compliance processes are established before deadlines.

## **NYDFS Insurance Circular Letter No. 7 (Section B)**

**Overview (How it Started, Issued & Effective Date)**
The New York Department of Financial Services issued **Circular Letter No. 7 on July 11, 2024** to clarify expectations for insurers using Artificial Intelligence Systems (AIS) and External Consumer Data and Information Sources (ECDIS) in underwriting and pricing. It became effective upon issuance and reflects supervisory expectations for transparency, governance, and consumer protection. ([Department of Financial Services][5])

**Who It Applies To**
All insurers licensed to write insurance in New York that use AIS and ECDIS in underwriting and pricing operations. ([Department of Financial Services][5])

**Regulatory Expectations**
Board oversight, documented internal controls, explainability, and compliance with existing anti-discrimination and insurance laws.

**Risk if Unmanaged**
Regulatory criticism, examination findings, or enforcement actions arising from opaque or poorly managed AI systems.

**Why the Leadership Should Care**
NYDFS serves as a leading regulator in financial services; failure to meet expectations could lead to enforcement or increased supervisory scrutiny in a major insurance market.

**Leadership Takeaway**
Ensure detailed documentation of AI use cases, demonstrate robust governance and oversight, and maintain readiness for NYDFS examinations.

## **NAIC Model Bulletin & AI Evaluation Tool (Draft)**

**Overview (How it Started, Issued & Effective Date)**
The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) adopted the **AI Model Bulletin and Exposure Draft of the AI Evaluation Tool in late 2023/early 2024** as a model for state adoption. These are **guidance documents**, not binding laws, but serve as a national benchmark for regulator examinations.

**Who It Applies To**
Insurers across the U.S. using AI, machine learning, or predictive analytics in underwriting, pricing, claims, or other core functions.

**Regulatory Expectations**
Consistent expectations around documented AI governance, inventories of AI systems, bias and performance testing, third‑party oversight, and regulator-ready documentation.

**Risk if Unmanaged**
Variable state exam outcomes, inconsistent regulatory findings, and greater compliance burden when entering multi-state examinations.

**Why the Leadership Should Care**
Even as non-binding models, they reflect regulators’ direction and are being adopted widely; failure to align increases enterprise risk.

**Leadership Takeaway**
Use NAIC guidance as an enterprise baseline and harmonize AI governance standards across all lines and jurisdictions.

## **State Bulletins on AI Imagery**

**Overview (How it Started, Issued & Effective Date)**
Several states began issuing bulletins focused on AI-generated imagery starting in **2021–2023** as the use of generative technologies increased in insurance claims and marketing. These are **supervisory bulletins or interpretive guidance**, not laws, but are effective upon issuance in each jurisdiction.

**Who It Applies To**
Insurers utilizing AI-generated or enhanced imagery in claims evaluation, marketing, consumer communications, or risk assessment.

**Regulatory Expectations**
Accuracy, transparency, nondiscrimination, clear disclosures, and oversight over third‑party image generation and vendor tools.

**Risk if Unmanaged**
Consumer complaints, misleading visual content, reputational risk, and potential regulatory involvement.

**Why the Leadership Should Care**
Generative AI images are often customer‑facing; poor governance can rapidly escalate into brand risk and consumer trust issues.

**Leadership Takeaway**
Implement governance and approval processes for AI-generated imagery, aligned disclosures, and oversight controls.

## **California CCPA – Automated Decision-Making (ADMT)**

**Overview (How it Started, Issued & Effective Date)**
The California Privacy Protection Agency (CPPA) finalized updated regulations under the **California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)** on **July 24, 2025**, including provisions for Automated Decision‑Making Technology (ADMT). These regulations were approved by the California Office of Administrative Law on **September 22, 2025** and **take effect January 1, 2026**, with ADMT requirements becoming enforceable **January 1, 2027**. ([California Privacy Protection Agency][6])

**Who It Applies To**
Insurers processing personal data of California residents when using automated decision‑making that significantly affects consumers.

**Regulatory Expectations**
Consumer notices, transparency around automated decisions, ability to explain decision logic, opt‑out rights, and integration with privacy and compliance programs.

**Risk if Unmanaged**
Privacy enforcement actions, regulatory penalties, litigation risk, and loss of consumer trust.

**Why the Leadership Should Care**
CCPA ADMT rules introduce privacy and consumer rights into AI governance, requiring cross‑functional controls, process changes, and consumer‑facing disclosures.

**Leadership Takeaway**
Align AI and privacy governance, implement transparency and opt‑out mechanisms, and prepare for phased compliance deadlines (2026–2027).
